# 2-deploy-nextjs-app-on-vercel.md

- Create Terraform files to create Vercel infrastructure to deploy the Next.JS application
- The application should automatically deploy when pushed to the `main` branch
- This will require access to API keys for Vercel -- create a robust environment management system with a central place for local and production API keys. Create files ending in `.example` with example versions of files.
