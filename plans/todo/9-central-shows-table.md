# 9-central-shows-table.md

- Currently, every user manages their own list of shows. Add a central shows table that stores all the information about a concert.
- The central shows table should include the show date, artist (only one), and venue (a unique venue id for a venue in the venues table)
- When a user adds a show, the shows table should be searched to see if that show already exists. If it doesn't, add it. If a user has multiple artists associated with a single show entry, that should be associated with multiple rows in the central shows table, one per artist.
- Use date, artist, and venue id to compose a unique show ID/slug. In rare cases, an artist might play multiple shows on the same date at the same venue. In cases where the user has multiple entries like this, add `-1`, `-2`, etc... to the end of the slug to handle multiples. In the manual show addition flow, show the potential show match and ask them to confirm. Give them the option to specify that this was indeed a show on the same date at the same venue before creating the second show entry.
- In the user shows table, each row should now consist of a list of shows and show notes. In most cases, there will be a single show associated with each row. In some cases, there will be multiple. In most cases, this is because the user has combined multiple artists performing at the same venue (e.g., a main act and opener) into a single show entry. For now, assume this is the case. On the table view, these rows should show the artists separated by + as they are now and one of the shows venue information should be arbitrarily used to fill the venue columns.
