# 1-create-nextjs-template.md

- Create a template Next.JS application in /web
- Reference [ARCHITECTURE](/ARCHITECTURE.md) for framework decisions
- The application should contain a single index screen that says "SHOWCOUNT" in the middle with a sub-caption "Concert tracking. Coming soon." Follow the [DESIGN](/DESIGN.md) guidelines.
- There should be a Makefile with commands to run/build the application locally.
