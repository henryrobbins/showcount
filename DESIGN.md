This file outlines the UI/UX design philosophy for showcount. The website is text- and data-rich. It's primary purpose is to present tabular data in a elegant and clean way. The color scheme is primarily black text on white background (like a newspaper) with minimal use of color. Typography should be similarly simple. Use monospace typography throughout, particularly for data displayed in tables. Lines of varying weights should be strategically used to visually separate UI components and data. On occasion, UI components can be surrounded with complete boxes with 90 degree angles. However, avoid fully grid-like interfaces.
