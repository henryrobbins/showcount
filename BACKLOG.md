- Use free OpenStreetMap API to automatically pull location from venue names
- Google Maps API for auto-suggesting venue locations during show addition
- Use Claude Tool or Skills to automatically parse any file format. Allow users to specify small prompt to improve performance. Allow users to manually bulk edit or chat to resolve parsing errors.
